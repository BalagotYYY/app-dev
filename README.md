## Extraordinary Attorney Woo
<p> Kang Tae-oh, Park Eun-bin, and Kang Ki-young all appear in the 2022 South Korean television series Extraordinary Attorney Woo (Korean: ). It centers on Woo Young-woo, a young autistic woman hired by a prestigious Seoul law firm. Her communication style is perceived by her neurotypical friends as being strange, awkward, and blunt because it differs from their own. She becomes a more capable lawyer with each legal case thanks to her brilliance and photographic memory.</p>
